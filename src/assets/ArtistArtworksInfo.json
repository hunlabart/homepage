    "artistBio": "Since 2003, Adrienne Richards has been exploring Australian landscapes for en plein air painting, using ink and watercolour. Her observations inspire her studio-based paintings and ceramics. Recently, she has focused on documenting coastal rivers, waterways, mangroves, and upland swamps in the Blue Mountains. With a museum background, Adrienne's work intersects with science, studying aquatic life under the microscope. She has been a finalist in art awards and exhibits regularly. Her work is found in private and public collections, including Maitland and Coffs Harbour Galleries. Her recent installation, 'The Way We Live Now', explores cultural watersheds in human development over the past 200,000 years.",

    "artworkName": "The Way We Live Now",
    "artworkDescription": "I created these works as part of 'The Way We Live Now' collection to explore Biohistory. They are inspired by the upland swamp near my home in the Blue Mountains, featuring rare creatures and evidence of human activity. I chose traditional ceramic plates as my medium. I captured images of children playing on a bush track, a canoe crossing a lagoon, and the flight path of an endangered Giant Dragonfly or a helicopter. Using hand-building, surface decoration, and glazing techniques, I created borders of lagoon rushes, imprints of animal teeth, and human-made embellishments that connected the plates to their environments.",

    "artworkDescription": "This artwork combines the beauty of nature and artistic creativity, presenting a fresh and innovative perspective distinct from the traditional form of ceramics. The pond within the piece represents the landscapes and vitality of nature, while the water droplet effect imbues the artwork with dynamic movement and depth. \nThe glaze imparts a unique shine and transparency to the surface, evoking the appearance of actual water droplets on a pond. Through the meticulous application of the bubble underglaze technique, I have created mesmerizing natural effects in my artwork. This ongoing experimentation with the underglaze bubble technique represents my commitment to pushing the boundaries of my craft and exploring new artistic possibilities.",

These durational and precise methodologies highlight the attributes of care and sensitivity which must be centred on our cooperation with the natural world. \nHudson’s ceramics entwine colonial and contemporary life and marine organisms in a subtle yet compelling critique of perpetuating environmental exploitation. Her delicate, floating drawings evoke a sense of ephemerality or transience, reflecting the haunting loss that accompanies our rapidly changing world.",

    "artworkDescription": "These sculptures are inspired by the processes of mineral solutions dripping in caves and weather-eroding soft substances from hard ones. They resemble stalagmites and are a hybrid of sculpture and cave formation, evoking both decomposition and deity. The works are a reinterpretation of Renaissance and neoclassical grotti and sentinel statuary but set in a future where they crumble and accrete in the fading of human existence. They also reflect on the anthropomorphisation of natural cave formations, where we search for familiar features and assign them identities as if they were members of a silent underground community.",

I witnessed the ever-changing and fragile icescapes: melting, cracking, falling, floating, and flowing. It made me reflect on my vulnerability and ephemeral existence. Time seemed to be still in the vastness, yet it seemed to accelerate. Porcelain, with its ice-like purity, translucency, and ability to reflect surrounding colours, felt like the appropriate material to capture this place. The Antarctic is under increasing threat from rising temperatures, the ice is breaking at an unprecedented pace. Sadly, this process cannot be arrested: the water cannot be stilled.",

I want to elicit the imagination of a vibrant marine world. The colours and tactile textures were achieved by combining slips, stains, underglaze and glaze, and spontaneously dripping, splashing, dabbing the brush, and ‘dancing’ with the vessel while the glaze was still running. Traces of my ephemeral expressive action were encapsulated in physical forms. I juxtaposed positive elements with negative space.

Formerly a pioneer in digital/web art direction, she left this career in 2002 to pursue a contemporary sculpture practice. Her work successfully bridges the gap between ceramic craft, technology and contemporary sculpture. \nConventional ceramicists may find her dualistic craft-conceptual platform unconventional as she frequently combines techniques of carving and moulding with hand-building and wheel-work. Inspired by Bernini's terracotta sketches, Collins combines ceramic firing and sophisticated gaze-tech with digital media. Despite this seeming complexity, her work is simple and unashamedly beautiful with gravity-defying forms that revel in wonkiness, with bold colours and a kind of painterly-ness and vulnerability. \nKirsty has a BFA(UNSW COFA) and a MFA in electronic and temporal art from USYD SCA.",

The sensuality of the surfaces invites you to feel Landscapes in motion, with silver clouds billowing up like fossilised vapour.

Fungi break down organisms to produce mushrooms, creating new life from death. The artwork highlights the regeneration process and the role of fungal networks in transferring nutrients to other organisms. Clay is used to capture these moments, and the glaze enhances the decomposition to regeneration theme. The human body is present but the fungal organisms are dominant, emphasising the relationship between humans and non-human organisms.

From functional tableware to unique vessels and sculptures, Turrin's approach is playful, with coil-building as the primary technique. The shapes he explores are traditional, informed by his love of ceramics history and found objects. Vibrant colours and intricate details highlight the markers of finger marks. Each piece is a site for experimentation of texture, colour, and functionality, and Turrin often uses discarded everyday objects to shape them. ‘Ceramics is meant to be touched’ Turrin says, so this tactility and obvious use of the hand is evident in all his works.",
